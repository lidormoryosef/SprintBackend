# 4Community – Smart Community Management Platform

**4Community** is a social-tech solution designed to help community managers organize, onboard, and empower their communities — using automation, AI, and intuitive tools.

---

## 📝 Overview

This project was created as part of a social initiative aimed at helping community leaders manage their members efficiently. The system allows managers to:

- Onboard new members via:
  - Manual form entry
  - Uploading a resume (PDF/DOCX)
  - Submitting a LinkedIn profile URL

- Use AI to automatically extract and format user data into structured profiles
- Manage community data (events, categories, notes, etc.)
- Assign users to relevant groups, categories, and activities
- Track experience, skills, and community involvement

Private users can easily register and join communities using smart entry methods powered by AI.

## 📈 Database Overview

The system uses Sequelize with MySQL and includes:

- `CommunityMember` — the main member model
- `Group`, `GroupMembers` — for managing group memberships
- `Event`, `MemberEvent` — for linking members to events
- `HistoryJob` — member job history records

Relationships are handled via `belongsToMany` and `hasMany` associations.
